# 🚗🧠 AI-Powered Car Assistant 

An intelligent, voice-activated assistant built using **Generative AI** and 
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, designed to enhance the in-vehicle 
experience for Tata Motor vehicle owners.

This project allows drivers to troubleshoot issues in real-time, receive 
voice-guided instructions on car features, and interact naturally through the 
car’s speaker and microphone systems.

> 🕊️ Built as a heartfelt tribute to the late Mr. Ratan Tata, a true visionary 
> and a national treasure whose legacy continues to inspire generations.

## 🚀 Features
> Instead of waiting for customer support like your crush’s reply 💔📞... get 
> instant answers from an AI 🤖 who actually knows your car inside out 🔧.

- **🎙️ Voice Input/Output**: Interact using natural language through the car's 
built-in mic and speaker.
- **🔧 Real-Time Troubleshooting**: Diagnose vehicle issues instantly with 
contextual, AI-powered answers.
- **📘 Feature Guidance**: Get detailed voice explanations of car 
functionalities and settings.
- **🔄 RAG-Powered Retrieval**: Combines LLM capabilities with a curated 
knowledge base for accurate, relevant answers.
- **🛠️ Extendable Architecture**: Built for future updates—like full voice 
control over car electronics.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Generative AI: Ollama (Alternatives - OpenAI, Gemini or others)
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for dynamic information access
- Speech Recognition:  Whisper (Alternatives - Vosk, Deepgram or others)
- Text-to-Speech: Coqui TTS (Alternatives - poly, gTTS, pyttsx3 or others)
- Python
- Microcontroller Integration (optional – for future voice-controlled actions)

## 📦 Installation
So, you want your car to talk back? Not in anger, but with helpful, AI-powered 
advice? Here's how you set it up:

### Clone the repo
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/AsutoshPati/Vehicle-Assistant-LLM.git
cd tata-ai-assistant
```

### Install Required Python Modules
I recommend to use Python 3.10 (tested and working beautifully). Then, 
install all dependencies:
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Load Up the Knowledge Base
I built this for TATA Altroz—because well, that’s the car I own. But you can 
train the assistant for any vehicle or gadget!
#### 🛠️ Here’s how:
- Download the official user manual (PDF) of your vehicle/device from the manufacturer's website.
- Place the PDF(s) into the /knowledge_base/ directory.
- Then, run this command to convert your manual into a searchable brain:
```commandline
python generate_knowledgebase.py
```
> 🤖 No PhD needed. Just your user manual and one command to rule them all.

### Set Up the LLM with Ollama
I am using LLaMA 3.2:3B via Ollama
#### Steps:
- Download & install Ollama from: https://ollama.com/download
- Then, download the model from https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2 or using:
```commandline
ollama run llama3.2:3b
```

### Run the Assistant
```commandline
python main.py
```
